.SH Directory Structure
Evoke uses a simple directory structure to organize your site.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]content/\f[R]: This directory contains all of your site\(cqs
content, including Markdown and HTML files.
It can also contain a \f[CR]_layout.html\f[R] file to define the base
layout for your pages.
The directory structure within the \f[CR]content\f[R] directory will be
used to generate the URLs for your site.
For example, a file at \f[CR]content/blog/my\-post.md\f[R] will be
available at \f[CR]/blog/my\-post.html\f[R].
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]public/\f[R]: This directory contains all of your site\(cqs static
assets, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
The contents of this directory will be copied to the \f[CR]dist\f[R]
directory when you build your site.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]partials/\f[R]: This directory contains all of your site\(cqs
partials, which are reusable HTML snippets that can be included in your
content files.
For example, you could create a partial for your site\(cqs header and
another for your site\(cqs footer.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]plugins/\f[R]: This directory contains all of your site\(cqs
plugins, which are Go plugins that can be used to extend Evoke\(cqs
functionality.
For example, you could create a plugin to add support for a new
templating language or to add a custom build step.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]dist/\f[R]: This directory is where your static site will be
generated.
You should not edit the contents of this directory directly, as it will
be overwritten every time you build your site.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]evoke.yaml\f[R]: An optional configuration file for your site.
This file can be used to configure your site\(cqs name, URL, and other
settings.
