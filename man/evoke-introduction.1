.SH Introduction to Plugins
Evoke\(cqs plugin system is a powerful feature that allows you to add
new functionality and customize the build process.
Plugins are built on a gRPC\-based architecture, which means you can
write them in any language that supports gRPC, including Go, Python,
JavaScript, and more.
.SS What Can Plugins Do?
With plugins, you can:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[B]Modify the build process:\f[R] Hook into the build process to
perform a wide range of actions, such as fetching data from an API,
processing images, or generating a sitemap.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[B]Customize content rendering:\f[R] Intercept and modify content at
various stages of the rendering pipeline.
For example, you could add a custom Markdown renderer, or post\-process
the HTML before it\(cqs written to disk.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[B]Integrate with other tools:\f[R] Connect Evoke to other services
and tools, such as content management systems, analytics platforms, or
deployment pipelines.
.SS How Do Plugins Work?
Evoke plugins are standalone executables that communicate with the Evoke
application over gRPC.
When you run a build, Evoke discovers and launches any plugins in your
\f[CR]plugins\f[R] directory, and then communicates with them at various
points in the build process.
.SS Plugin Hooks
Plugins can execute code at specific points in the build process using
the following hooks:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]OnPreBuild()\f[R]: This method is called before the build process
begins.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]OnConfigLoaded()\f[R]: This method is called after the
configuration is loaded, but before it is used.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]OnPublicAssetsCopied()\f[R]: This method is called after the
public assets have been copied to the output directory.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]OnPostBuild()\f[R]: This method is called after the build process
has completed.
.SS The Plugin Interface
All plugins must implement the \f[CR]Plugin\f[R] service, which is
defined in the \f[CR]plugin.proto\f[R] file.
You can find the full definition of the service and its messages in the
Plugin Service Definition documentation.
