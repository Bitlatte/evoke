.SH Evoke: Simply magical.
Welcome to the official documentation for Evoke.
Evoke is a static site generator that operates on the principle of
\(lqIt just works.\(rq It\(cqs not about complex commands or convoluted
processes, but about the purity and speed of a tool so refined it feels
like a natural extension of the developer\(cqs will.
.SS Why Evoke?
There are a lot of static site generators out there, so why build
another one?
The answer is simple: I wanted a static site generator that was small,
fast, and powerful, but also easy to use.
I wanted a tool that would let me build a website without having to
worry about a lot of configuration or setup.
I also wanted a tool that was extensible, so I could add new features
and functionality as needed.
.PP
Evoke is the result of that vision.
It\(cqs a tool that I use every day to build my own websites, and I hope
that you\(cqll find it as useful as I do.
