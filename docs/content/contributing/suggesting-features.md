# Suggesting Features

We're always looking for new ideas to improve Evoke. If you have an idea for a new feature, we'd love to hear it. The best way to suggest a feature is to create a new issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bitlatte/evoke/issues).

When suggesting a feature, please include the following information:

-   A clear and descriptive title.
-   A detailed description of the feature, including the problem it solves and how it would work.
-   Any relevant examples or mockups.

This information will help us to understand your idea and determine if it's a good fit for the project.
