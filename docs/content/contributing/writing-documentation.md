# Writing Documentation

We're always looking for help with writing and improving our documentation. If you're interested in helping out, you can start by forking the [Evoke repository](https://github.com/Bitlatte/evoke) on GitHub and cloning it to your local machine.

All of our documentation is written in Markdown and is located in the `docs/content` directory.

## Documentation Style

When writing documentation, please try to follow these guidelines:

-   Use clear and concise language.
-   Use examples to illustrate your points.
-   Use a consistent tone and style.
-   Use proper grammar and spelling.

## Submitting Changes

When you're ready to submit your changes, please create a pull request to the `main` branch of the Evoke repository. In your pull request, please include a detailed description of your changes and any relevant information that will help us to review them.
