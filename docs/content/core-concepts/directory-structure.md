# Directory Structure

Evoke uses a simple directory structure to organize your site.

*   `content/`: This directory contains all of your site's content, including Markdown and HTML files.
*   `public/`: This directory contains all of your site's static assets, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
*   `partials/`: This directory contains all of your site's partials, which are reusable HTML snippets that can be included in your content files.
*   `extensions/`: This directory contains all of your site's extensions, which are Go plugins that can be used to extend Evoke's functionality.
*   `dist/`: This directory is where your static site will be generated.
