# Evoke: A Powerful, Simple, and Fast Static Site Generator

Welcome to the official documentation for Evoke, a static site generator that is small, fast, and powerful. Evoke is designed to be easy to use, with sensible defaults that allow for near-zero configuration. It also has full template support and an extension system that allows you to extend the core functionality.

## Why Evoke?

There are a lot of static site generators out there, so why build another one? The answer is simple: I wanted a static site generator that was small, fast, and powerful, but also easy to use. I wanted a tool that would let me build a website without having to worry about a lot of configuration or setup. I also wanted a tool that was extensible, so I could add new features and functionality as needed.

Evoke is the result of that vision. It's a tool that I use every day to build my own websites, and I hope that you'll find it as useful as I do.
